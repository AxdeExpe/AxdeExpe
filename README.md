### About Me

I believe in the power of technology to drive positive change and improve lives. With a background in computer science and a knack for problem-solving, I enjoy diving deep into challenging projects and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new coding languages, experimenting with algorithms, or exploring the outdoors for inspiration.

### Experience

During my time as a student assistant (HiWi), I gained valuable experience at Fraunhofer Institute for Transportation and Infrastructure Systems (IVI). In particular, I contributed to projects in the field of agriculture, as depicted in the following flyer from the institute:

These experiences enhanced my skills in applying technologies and methodologies to solve real-world problems and provided me with valuable insights into the workings of a leading research institute.

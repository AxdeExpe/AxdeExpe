### Experience

During my time as a student assistant (HiWi), I gained valuable experience at Fraunhofer Institute for Transportation and Infrastructure Systems (IVI). In particular, I contributed to projects in the field of agriculture, as depicted in the following flyer from the institute:

[![Fraunhofer IVI Flyer](https://www.ivi.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/ivi/de/dokumente/flyer/FL_Hely_OS_Landwirtschaft_web.pdf)](https://www.ivi.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/ivi/de/dokumente/flyer/FL_Hely_OS_Landwirtschaft_web.pdf)

These experiences enhanced my skills in applying technologies and methodologies to solve real-world problems and provided me with valuable insights into the workings of a leading research institute.
